# Firefox Theme Starter
Ready to use structure and assets to develop your own full themes for Firefox


### How to

This is a summary document of the [official MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Building_a_Theme)

1. Find your Firefox profile and open the `extensions` folder that it's inside. If is not there, create one.

2. Create a file named `starter@theme.io`.

3. Put inside that file the system path that points to the location of the theme. For example `/Users/username/Desktop/FirefoxThemeStarterKit/theme`

4. Open Firefox, go to the Plugins section and enable the starter theme.

5.  Firefox will ask for reboot to apply changes. Once is rebooted your theme is enabled and working.


To speed up the process of developing the theme i suggest to insert this address inside the url bar in the browser:
`chrome://browser/content/browser.xul`

It will load the main tabs and menu bars inside the browser, so you can inspect if from the developer tools.

### Disclaimer

I highly suggest to read the [full guide from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Building_a_Theme) as it covers much more information than this short doc.
